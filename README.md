# Encrypted File Access

## TODOs

- Complete the encrypted file format specification.
- Implement the create file feature.
- Implement the open file feature.
- Allow users change the password. This should change the data encryption key (DEK).

## Note

- Generate a new DEK every time the data is changed.
